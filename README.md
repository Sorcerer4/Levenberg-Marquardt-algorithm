# Levenberg-Marquardt-algorithm
Simple algoritm that uses Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to solve nonlinear optimization problems. The method is based Newton's method for optimsation but adds a damping factor to the hessian matrix in order to always ensure descent direction. This results in improved reliability by avoiding saddle points, compared to the newton method.
